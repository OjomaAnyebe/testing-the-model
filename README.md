## About the Exercise

In this exercise, i focused on testing a machine learning model to evaluate its generalization performance. Model testing is a crucial step in understanding how well a trained model performs on unseen data.

### Objectives
- Evaluate the model using testing datasets.
- Interpret key performance metrics.
- Compare testing performance with training results to identify overfitting or underfitting.

## Dataset Details

- **Dataset Name**: `real_estate_price_size_year.csv`
- **Target Variable**: Price (dependent variable).
- **Features**:
  - Size: Square footage of the property.
  - Year: Year of construction.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For dataset manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For model testing and evaluation.

## Key Steps in the Notebook

1. **Import Libraries and Load Data**:
   Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
2. **Split Data into Training and Testing Sets**:
   Divide the data into training and testing subsets.
3. **Train the Model**:
   Train a linear regression model on the training set.
4. **Evaluate the Model**:
   - Calculate performance metrics such as:
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - Analyze predictions on the test set.
5. **Draw Conclusions**:
   Compare testing and training results to assess model reliability.
